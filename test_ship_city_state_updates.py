TESTING SCRIPT - Ship City & Ship State Dynamic Updates
=======================================================
This script demonstrates how to test the new Ship City and Ship State 
dynamic update functionality when order status changes from Pending.

Testing Scenarios:
1. Order status change from Pending to Shipped/Ordered
2. Order with missing Ship City/State gets updated
3. Order with different Ship City/State gets corrected
4. Only orders from last 6 hours are processed

IMPORTANT: This is a testing guide, not an executable script.
